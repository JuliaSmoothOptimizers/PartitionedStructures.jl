# PartitionedStructures.jl: Partitioned derivatives storage and partitioned quasi-Newton updates

## Compatibility
Julia â‰¥ 1.6.

## How to install
```julia
pkg> add PartitionedStructures
pkg> test PartitionedStructures
```

## Philosophy
Methods exploiting the derivatives of partially-separable functions require specific data structures to store partitioned derivatives.
There are several types of partial separability.
We write a partially-separable function $f: \R^n \to \R$ in the form
```math
  f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^N f_i (U_i(x)),\; f_i : \R^{n_i} \to \R, \; U_i \in \R^{n_i \times n},\; n_i \ll n
```
where:
- $f_i$ is the $i$-th element function whose dimension is smaller than $f$;
- $U_i$ the linear operator selecting the linear combinations of variables that parametrize $f_i$.

In the case of partitioned quasi-Newton methods, they require storing partitioned gradients and the partitioned Hessian approximation.
[PartitionedStructures.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/PartitionedStructures.jl) facilitates the definition of those partitioned structures and defines methods to manipulate them.

## Features
$U_i$ may be based on the *elemental* variables or the *internal* variables of $f_i$:
- the elemental variables represent the subset of variables that parametrizes $f_i$, i.e. the rows of $U_i$ are vectors from the Euclidean basis;
```
Ui = [1,3,5] # i.e. [1 0 0 0 0; 0 0 1 0 0; 0 0 0 0 1]
```
- the internal variables are linear combinations of the variables that parametrize $f_i$, i.e. $U_i$ may be a dense matrix.

The implementation of the linear-operators $U_i$, which describe entirely the partially-separable structure of $f$, changes depending on wether we use internal or elemental variables.

At the moment, **we only support the elemental partitioned structure**, but we left the door open to develop the internal partitioned structure in the future.

## Modules using [PartitionedStructures.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/PartitionedStructures.jl)
The structures defined here are used in the modules [PartitionedVectors.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/PartitionedVectors.jl) and [PartiallySeparableNLPModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/PartiallySeparableNLPModels.jl)
