Create an $(_epm) and an $(_epv).
Both have the same partitioned structure defined by the size of the problem `n::Int`, the size of the element `nie::Int` and the overlapping between the consecutive elements `overlapping::Int`.
Each elemental element-matrix is fill with ones, except the terms of the diagonal of value `mul_v::Real`.
The value of each elemental element-vector is `rand(nie) .* mul_v::Real`.
**Warning:** You have to choose carefully the values `n`, `nie` and `overlap`, otherwise the method may fail.
The default values are correct.
